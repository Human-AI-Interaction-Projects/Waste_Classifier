## Waste Classifier

According to the World Bank, our global waste production from September 2018, is predicted to rise by 70 percent by 2050 unless we take urgent action. We human beings currently produce two billion tonnes of waste per year between 7.6 billion people. Population increase may be part of the problem, but it’s levels of consumption within developed countries, and their gross mismanagement of waste, that let to the environmental catastrophe.

What’s worse, until now, the most popular approach of managing the waste is still incineration. The bad part of this “efficient method” is that if the garbage is not well classified, it produces large amount of toxic gases around the incineration area, which potentially cause death to infants and other diseases to residents.

So, in order to protect the health of those who live near the garbage station, and to protect the environment, we came up with our waste classification app that can help us to restrict the emission of toxic gases by improving our garbage classification process.

### Introduction

Our app is called Waste Classifier, which is consist of two main parts with two human-AI interaction aspects, the Explainable AI and the AI feedback system. 

The first function of our app, also the main ability of our app is recognizing the object in a real-time frame, to see if the object is recyclable or organic. In this function, we introduced the Explainable AI concept. Users are allowed to look into each layer of the decision-making process, each of which contains a short description of why our model predict the result in certain manner. This idea helps the users to understand and to learn new knowledge of how to classify the disposal.

Another capability of our app is that it takes back the incorrect data, that the users report when they find out that the prediction of our model is clearly wrong. This feedback system allows us producers to look into where we did wrong, to consistently renew our database online, and to improve our AI model in order to provide more accurate predictions.
